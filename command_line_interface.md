## [VIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_\(text_editor\))

Vim is a fork of Bill Joy's vi text editor program for Unix. Vim's author, Bram
Moolenaar, based it on the source code for a port of the Stevie editor to the
Amiga (Commodore 1985) and released a version to the public in 1991.

Its an easy~ish way to edit files via CLI. Having commands makes it easier.
Might be able to resuse some bash commands here.

Shortcuts     | Description
------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
`esc`         | Go back to the "command line" in vim
:`wq`         | Write changes, quit.
ctrl-u        | Delete from cursor to the start of a line
:`d$`         | Delete characters from the cursor to the end of the line
:[from],[to]d | Delete lines `from`, `to` where `to` can be `$` last line or #
/-m           | Move cursor to the first occurrence "-m" in the file
n             | Find the next "-m"

## Miscellaneous Stuff

Commands I found useful and dont wan't to forget although I probably won't ever
use them, I just think they are cool because I'm not a good CLI user.
